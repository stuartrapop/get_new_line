The openat() function is equivalent to the open() function except in the case where the path specifies a
relative path.  In this case the file to be opened is determined relative to the directory associated with
the file descriptor fd instead of the current working directory.  The oflag argument and the optional
fourth argument correspond exactly to the arguments for open().  If openat() is passed the special value
AT_FDCWD in the fd argument, the current working directory is used and the behavior is identical to a call
to open().
